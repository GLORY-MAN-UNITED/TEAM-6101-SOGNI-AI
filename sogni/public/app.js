  "The Ampersand (&) in the D&D logo is stylized as a dragon!",
  "The famous 20-sided die (d20) predates D&D â€” polyhedral dice were imported from Japan in the 1960s.",

  "The first D&D campaign world was Greyhawk, created by Gary Gygax.",
  "Many monsters, like Mind Flayers, were inspired by sci-fi rather than fantasy.",

  "The Dungeon Master's Screen was introduced in 1979 to hide dice rolls and notes.",
  "The Deck of Many Things has been ruining campaigns since 1975.",
  "Alignment (Lawful/Chaotic, Good/Evil) was originally inspired by Michael Moorcock's fantasy novels.",
  "The Gelatinous Cube was invented specifically to 'fit perfectly in a 10-foot dungeon corridor.'",
