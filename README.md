# TEAM-6101-SOGNI-AI
# DND Character Card Generator

A decentralized AI avatar maker built with the **Sogni SDK**, designed to help Dungeons & Dragons players and Dungeon Masters create unique, high-quality character portraits without relying on generic art from existing asset libraries.

## 🚀 Introduction

This project was developed as part of the **NTU x Base Web3 Hackathon** under the **Sogni AI track** by **Group 6101**. Our goal is to deliver a customizable, web-based AI art experience that is accessible on both desktop and mobile devices, with no sign-up required.

## ✨ Features

- **Customizable Portraits**: Generate unique D&D character portraits based on age, gender, race, class, background, location, and color preferences
- **Decentralized Infrastructure**: Leverages distributed computing via the Sogni SDK for reliable and efficient image generation
- **User-Friendly**: No mandatory sign-up—start generating immediately
- **Cross-Platform**: Fully responsive design optimized for desktop and mobile
- **Download & Modify**: Easily download your character card or make further modifications

## 🛠️ Technical Highlights

- **Automated Prompt Assembly**: Dynamically combines user inputs to create precise AI prompts for detailed image control
- **Decentralized Compute Infrastructure**: Uses distributed resources with streaming progress and fallback mechanisms
- **Performance Optimization**: Implements responsive layout, CDN caching, lazy loading, and compression for fast loading and compatibility
- **Frictionless UX**: Delivers core functionality without barriers

## 🎯 Value Proposition

- **For Players**: Enhance immersion and self-expression with truly unique character art
- **For DMs**: Quickly generate portraits for characters and NPCs to enrich storytelling
- **Foundation for Future Features**: Supports upcoming additions like stat visualization, style packs, and batch generation
